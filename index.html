    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the EBIT<br> 
    What is the EBIT?<br>
    The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a measurement of the company's profitability that excludes the interest and income tax expenses.<br>
    How to calculate EBIT?<br>
    To calculate EBIT you should use the following formula:<br>
    earnings before interest and tax = revenue - cost of goods sold (COGS) - operating expenses<br>
    Example: company x has a revenue of $640,000, $220,000 worth of cost of goods sold (COGS) and $40,000 in operating expenses, calculate the EBIT.<br>
    Using the EBIT formula the answer will be:<br>
    earnings before interest and tax = revenue - cost of goods sold - operating expenses<br>
    earnings before interest and tax = $640,000 - $220,000 - $40,000<br>
    earnings before interest and tax = $380,000<br>
    Why use EBIT?<br>
    EBIT is used to provide a measurement of a company's profitability from operations because it doesn't account for the expenses associated with taxes and interest.<br>
